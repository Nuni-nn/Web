    <p>The orchestra plays its final song.  
    He leads you gently back into the hall, though the crowd has thinned,  
    and for a moment it feels as though the music exists only for you both.</p>

    <p>His arm encircles you, his hand steady against yours.  
    The two of you move as though youâ€™ve always danced together â€”  
    every step guided by trust and something deeper.</p>

    <p>Candles flicker, shadows soften, and as the night comes to a close,  
    you realize: this is not just a dance â€” this is a promise.</p>

    <p>And the castle, timeless and vast, becomes witness to the beginning of your story.</p>
