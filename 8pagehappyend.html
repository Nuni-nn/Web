        <h1>HAPPY END</h1>
        <p>The orchestra plays its final song. He leads you gently back into the hall, though the crowd has thinned, and for a moment it feels as though the music exists only for you both.</p> <p>His arm encircles you, his hand steady against yours. The two of you move as though youâ€™ve always danced together, every step guided by trust and something deeper.</p> <p>Candles flicker, shadows soften, and as the night comes to a close, you realize: this is not just a dance. This is a promise.</p> <p>And the castle, timeless and vast, becomes witness to the beginning of your story.</p>
