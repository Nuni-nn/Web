            The ballroom overwhelms you at once. Crystal chandeliers hang like constellations, scattering light across polished marble floors. Hundreds of guests in glittering masks fill the hall, their movements a blur of color and elegance.
<p>The music is intoxicating, every note of the orchestra filling the air like magic. You catch fragments of laughter, whispers of secrets, the rustle of gowns and the clink of crystal glasses.
<p>And then… the world slows.
<p>Through the crowd, you feel a presence before you even see him. His gaze finds yours as though it had been searching the entire evening. Tall, poised, and wrapped in the mystery of a black and silver mask, he moves toward you with a grace that makes the bustling hall fade into silence.
<p>When he bows, it is with the courtesy of someone raised in a palace—yet there is no arrogance, only sincerity.
<p>— “Good evening, mysterious stranger,” he says softly, his voice smooth yet carrying warmth. “My name is hidden, as it should be, but names matter less when the night belongs to masks. What matters is you. Something about you…” His eyes linger as though trying to memorize your presence. “…draws me in. Would you grant me the honor of your company?”
