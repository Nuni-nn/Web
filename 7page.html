      <h1>Under the Moonlight</h1>

      <p>The ball has nearly ended. The music drifts softly, chandeliers dim as guests depart.  
      Yet here, on the moonlit balcony, the world belongs only to you and him.</p>

      <p>He takes your hand gently, his thumb brushing your skin.  
      His mask conceals part of his face — but not the warmth in his eyes.</p>

      <p><em>“[Name],”</em> he whispers, <em>“I do not know what tomorrow will bring.  
      My life is bound by duty and expectation. Yet tonight, for the first time, I feel free.  
      I want this night to be more than memory — I want it to be a beginning.”</em></p>

      <p>His voice trembles with sincerity. The air holds still — as if even the moon waits for your answer.</p>

      <p><em>“But the choice… is yours.”</em></p>
