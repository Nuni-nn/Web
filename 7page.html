        <p>The ball has nearly ended. The music is softer now, the chandeliers dimming as guests depart. Yet here on the balcony, beneath a silver moon, the world belongs only to you and him.</p> <p>He takes your hand gently, his thumb brushing your skin. His mask hides part of his face, but not the emotion in his eyes.</p> <p>— “[Name], I do not know what tomorrow will bring. I live in a world of duty and expectation. Yet tonight, for the first time, I feel free. I want this night to be more than memory. I want it to be a beginning.”</p> <p>His voice trembles with honesty. — “But the choice… is yours.”</p>
