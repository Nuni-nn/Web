      <h1>The Garden of Secrets</h1>

      <p>The noise of the ballroom fades as you step outside. The night air is cool and crisp, carrying the fragrance of roses. Lanterns glow along stone paths, guiding you toward a marble fountain where moonlight shimmers on the water’s surface.</p>

      <p>The prince walks beside you — no longer the figure of perfect formality, but something more human, more alive. His mask hides part of his face, but not his eyes. They watch you with curiosity, as though you hold the answer to a question he has long carried.</p>

      <p><em>“Do you know why I asked you out here?”</em> he begins, his voice lower now, intimate against the hush of the night.  
      “Because in that hall filled with splendor, I felt something different in you, <strong>[Name]</strong>.  
      Most people dance as though someone is watching, as though their every step is a performance.  
      But you… you were simply yourself. Even in stillness, you shone.”</p>

      <p>Your heart stirs at his words.</p>

      <p>He pauses, then smiles — almost shyly.  
      <em>“Tell me about you. Not the mask, not the gown… <strong>you</strong>.  
      I want to know who you are when the music fades.”</em></p>
