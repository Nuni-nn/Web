    <p>The silence is heavier than words. You pull your hand away,  
    your heart twisting even as you make the choice.</p>

    <p>His eyes widen — confusion and quiet pain reflecting in the moonlight.  
    <em>“[Name]…”</em> he whispers, but you are already stepping back.</p>

    <p>You vanish into the thinning crowd, leaving him on the balcony beneath the fading moon.</p>

    <p>Later, you will remember this night — the music, the lights,  
    the way his eyes searched yours.  
    You will remember… and wonder what might have been.</p>

    <p>But it will remain unfinished — a story without an ending.</p>
