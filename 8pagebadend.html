        <p>The silence is heavier than words. You pull your hand away, your heart twisting even as you make the choice.</p> <p>His eyes widen, filled with confusion and quiet pain. — “[Name]…” he whispers, but you are already stepping back.</p> <p>You disappear into the thinning crowd, leaving him on the balcony beneath the fading moon.</p> <p>Later, you will remember this night. The music, the lights, the way his eyes searched yours. You will remember… and wonder what might have been.</p> <p>But it will remain unfinished, a story without an ending.</p>
