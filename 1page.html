        <p>The city is wrapped in twilight, its rooftops glowing faintly beneath the fading sun. The castle towers above all else, grand and timeless, its many windows burning with golden fire. Tonight it is alive, not with politics or power, but with music, laughter, and dreams.
<p>You stand at the castle gates, your invitation trembling in your hand. The parchment feels strangely heavy, as though it carries more than just ink and waxâ€”it carries possibility.
<p>You had not expected to be here. Perhaps it was chance, perhaps fate, but now you are part of the evening that all the city whispers about. Somewhere inside waits the crown prince, heir to the throne, a man both admired and feared.
<p>For most, this ball is about appearances, politics, and alliances. But for youâ€¦ it is something else. A door you never imagined would open.
<p>Your heart races as you look up at the open gates, glowing with light. Music drifts into the night, carrying with it an unspoken promise.</p>
