      <h1>At the Castle Gates</h1>
      <p>The city is wrapped in twilight, its rooftops glowing beneath the fading sun. The castle towers above, grand and timeless, its windows burning with golden fire.</p>
      <p>Tonight it is aliveâ€”not with politics or power, but with music, laughter, and dreams.</p>
      <p>You stand at the castle gates, your invitation trembling in your hand. The parchment feels strangely heavy, as though it carries more than just ink and waxâ€”it carries possibility.</p>
      <p>Somewhere inside waits the crown prince, heir to the throne, a man both admired and feared.</p>
      <p>For most, this ball is about appearances and alliances. But for youâ€¦ it is something elseâ€”a door you never imagined would open.</p>
      <p>Your heart races as you look up at the open gates. Music drifts into the night, carrying with it an unspoken promise.</p>
