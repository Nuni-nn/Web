      <h1>A Moment Interrupted</h1>

      <p>The garden becomes your private world. The prince listens with rare attentiveness, leaning closer with every word you speak. He laughs genuinely at your humor, and when silence lingers, it feels comfortable rather than awkward.</p>

      <p><em>“Do you realize,”</em> he says quietly, <em>“that it’s rare to find someone who speaks without calculation? Everyone I meet speaks to impress, to gain favor, to hide. But you… you speak to connect. And I cannot look away.”</em></p>

      <p>Your chest warms at his confession. For a moment, you wonder if this is truly real.</p>

      <p>But then, footsteps approach. A servant appears, bowing deeply.</p>

      <p><em>“Your Highness, the council awaits you inside.”</em></p>

      <p>The prince’s shoulders stiffen, his jaw tightening at the reminder of duty. He looks back at you, regret heavy in his expression.</p>

      <p><em>“Forgive me, [Name]. I cannot ignore this call. But leaving you feels wrong.”</em></p>
