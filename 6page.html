      <h1>His Return</h1>

      <p>The garden feels emptier without him. Doubt whispers — perhaps you were foolish to believe,  
      perhaps this was nothing more than a fleeting dream.</p>

      <p>But then — footsteps.  
      He is there again, his breath uneven as though he hurried, and in his hand rests a delicate flower plucked from the royal garden.  
      Its petals glisten with dew beneath the lantern light.</p>

      <p><em>“Forgive me, [Name],”</em> he says softly, his voice tinged with relief.  
      <em>“I couldn’t let this night end unfinished. I wanted to return to you — with something, however small.  
      This flower… it is yours.”</em></p>

      <p>He extends it with trembling sincerity — and for the first time, the night feels like it truly belongs to both of you.</p>
